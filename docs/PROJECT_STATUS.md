# Project Status

## Branch Status

`main` is the Phase 55 stable baseline after PR #17 merged the Phase 43-55 Combined Release Candidate and after post-merge stabilization landed. PR #3-#14 are marked merged after PR #17 because their changes are contained in `main`; PR #1 and PR #15 are closed as superseded after verification.

## Active Next Slice

`codex/phase-61g-commercial-operation-deliverables` is the active next branch. It adds Phase 61G Commercial Operation Deliverables: `commercial_operation_deliverables`, `/api/v1/commercial-operations/{operation_id}/deliverables`, an Admin Dashboard Deliverables panel, linked Output Library artifacts with `source_type=commercial_operation`, and explicit create/update/ready/approve/reject/package/fail/archive records for commercial handoff packages. It still does not publish, execute external actions, run Browser Worker actions, run OpenClaw actions, run ComfyUI jobs, control real accounts, or bypass approval.

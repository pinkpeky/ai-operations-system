# Project Status

## Branch Status

`main` is the Phase 55 stable baseline after PR #17 merged the Phase 43-55 Combined Release Candidate and after post-merge stabilization landed. PR #3-#14 are marked merged after PR #17 because their changes are contained in `main`; PR #1 and PR #15 are closed as superseded after verification. PR #16 was accepted into the Phase 54 branch before PR #17 merged to `main`. Phase 56 was reverted and is not active. Phase 56A-56D readiness work has landed on `main`, adding CI gates, required-check documentation, release readiness artifacts, and scheduled server Docker smoke. Phase 57A-57D, Phase 58A-58E, Phase 59A-59C, and Phase 60A-60C have also landed on `main`, adding the Admin Dashboard Run Cockpit, guarded cockpit actions, operator controls, deep links, refresh UX, Playbooks context, Output Library context handoff, Phase 58 closeout, Run Cockpit search density, workflow handoff, workflow focus/provenance, the frontend language foundation, the Overview role entry, and the Conversations operator console.

## Active Next Slice

`codex/phase-60-rag-documents-simplification` is the active next branch. It adds a Chinese-first RAG Documents knowledge console, localized health/collection/document/search labels, operator summary cards, clearer hybrid retrieval feedback, and inline search errors. It does not reuse the reverted Phase 56 branch.

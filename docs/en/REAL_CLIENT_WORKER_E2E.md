# Real Client Worker E2E Validation

Status: completed validation plan and script. Real customer-machine E2E success must be executed later when the customer machine is online. Do not fabricate or backfill a passing real-client result.

## Goal

Validate the final Phase 34 chain:

```text
AI Server
-> RemoteBrowserProvider
-> BrowserWorkerSelector
-> real customer-machine worker_client
-> local browser_runtime
-> local Playwright Chromium
-> screenshot / page content / status returned to AI Server
```

## Customer Machine Preparation

Required:

- Python 3.11+
- project source or packaged `worker_client`
- Playwright
- Chromium browser runtime

Install:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

Optional for Worker Console Desktop native validation:

- Node.js
- Rust
- MSVC Build Tools on Windows

If Rust/MSVC is not ready, mark desktop native validation pending. Do not pretend `npm run tauri dev` passed.

## worker_config.yaml Example

```yaml
server_url: http://AI_SERVER_HOST:8000
worker_name: customer-machine-worker-1
worker_type: playwright
workspace_id: demo-workspace
worker_secret: null
heartbeat_interval_seconds: 30
runtime_host: 127.0.0.1
runtime_port: 9100
capabilities:
  browser: chromium
  browser_runtime: true
  screenshot: true
  page_content: true
  persistent_profile: false
```

Security note: do not expose port 9100 to the public internet. Prefer Tailscale, VPN, or a trusted LAN. The worker runtime should listen on localhost unless there is an explicit private-network deployment reason.

## Worker Registration And Startup

```bash
cp worker_client/worker_config.example.yaml worker_client/worker_config.yaml
python -m worker_client.cli register --config worker_client/worker_config.yaml
python -m worker_client.cli start --config worker_client/worker_config.yaml
```

The registration step stores `worker_state.json` locally. Do not commit it. Do not paste the worker secret into docs, issues, screenshots, or logs.

## Worker Console Checklist

Web Console:

```bash
cd worker_console
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Check:

- `registered=true`
- `runtime_running=true`
- `heartbeat_running=true`
- `current_status=online`
- logs show heartbeat success
- Browser Sessions Panel can refresh active sessions

Desktop Console:

```bash
cd worker_console_desktop
npm run tauri dev
```

If Rust/MSVC is not installed or still being validated, record: `desktop native validation pending`.

## Swagger Validation Flow

Headers:

```text
X-Workspace-Id: demo-workspace
X-User-Id: demo-user
```

Steps:

1. `GET /api/v1/health`
2. `GET /api/v1/browser-workers/health/summary`
3. `GET /api/v1/browser-workers/available`
4. `POST /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions`
5. `POST /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/navigate`
6. `POST /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/screenshot`
7. `GET /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/page`
8. `POST /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/close`

Create session:

```json
{
  "browser": "chromium",
  "metadata": {
    "phase": "35B",
    "source": "swagger"
  }
}
```

Navigate:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

Screenshot:

```json
{
  "full_page": true,
  "screenshot_name": "real-client-worker-e2e-example"
}
```

## E2E Script Validation

Run:

```bash
python scripts/validate_real_client_worker_e2e.py \
  --server-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --workspace-id demo-workspace \
  --user-id demo-user \
  --expected-worker-name customer-machine-worker-1
```

Exit codes:

- `0`: PASS
- `1`: FAIL
- `2`: SKIPPED / client unavailable

If `expected_worker_name` is not online, the script returns `SKIPPED` with reason `real client worker not online` and does not execute browser actions.

## Server Configuration Checks

The script inspects:

- `BROWSER_PROVIDER`
- `BROWSER_WORKER_AUTH_ENABLED`
- `BROWSER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` includes `example.com`
- browser runtime OpenAPI routes exist
- `storage/browser_screenshots` / `BROWSER_RUNTIME_SCREENSHOT_DIR`

If `BROWSER_PROVIDER` is not `remote`, the script emits a WARNING rather than failing. The Phase 34 browser runtime API can still be validated directly, but old browser action API paths may continue using the mock provider.

## Common Troubleshooting

- Worker not listed: verify `worker_config.yaml`, registration, workspace id, and heartbeat loop.
- Worker listed but not available: check `max_sessions`, `active_sessions`, `status`, and `capabilities.browser_runtime`.
- Browser action fails: run `playwright install chromium` on the customer machine.
- Screenshot missing: check `storage/browser_screenshots` on AI Server and local worker logs.
- Connection refused: do not open port 9100 publicly; use Tailscale, VPN, or LAN routing.

## Boundaries

Current Phase 35B is only a validation plan and script. It does not implement TikTok / YouTube / X automation, login automation, cookie injection, proxy pools, fingerprint bypass, captcha automation, real platform automation, OpenClaw real device, or ComfyUI.
## Phase 35A Debug Extension

After a real client E2E run, use the Browser Runtime Observability APIs to inspect execution:

1. `GET /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/events`
2. `GET /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/snapshots`
3. `POST /api/v1/browser-runtime/sessions/{session_id}/replay`
4. `GET /api/v1/browser-runtime/replays/{replay_id}/export`

These endpoints create Timeline, Snapshot Storage, and metadata-only replay. They do not re-run browser actions and are not live stream, VNC, noVNC, or DevTools remote control.

## Phase 36: Server Admin Dashboard Foundation

`admin_dashboard` is now part of the docs SSOT. It is a read-only monitoring foundation for Overview, Workers, Browser Runtime, Conversations, Tasks, OpenClaw, Audit Logs, RAG / Documents, and Settings. Runtime config is `VITE_AI_SERVER_API=http://localhost:8000`, `VITE_WORKSPACE_ID=demo-workspace`, and `VITE_USER_ID=demo-user`. The API client lives at `admin_dashboard/src/api/client.ts` and exports `workersApi`, `browserRuntimeApi`, `conversationsApi`, `tasksApi`, `openclawApi`, `auditApi`, and `ragApi`. Current boundaries: no login UI, no permission UI, no publishing business flow, no real social platform control, no production-grade operations backend.

## Phase 37: Conversation Runtime Frontend Integration

Status: completed, Phase 37.

Phase 37 connects the Conversation Runtime to Server Admin Dashboard, Worker Console Web, and Worker Console Desktop. The current scope is Conversation frontend integration and a basic conversation entrypoint. It is not a full ChatGPT UI and it is not WebSocket / SSE streaming.

Completed:

- Admin Dashboard Conversation page: `admin_dashboard` Conversations supports create thread, thread list, thread detail, message list, event timeline, send message, run conversation, refresh messages, and refresh events.
- Admin Dashboard client: `admin_dashboard/src/api/conversationClient.ts` supports `createThread`, `listThreads`, `getThread`, `sendMessage`, `listMessages`, `listEvents`, and `runConversation`.
- Worker Console Chat Panel: `worker_console` supports AI Server URL, Workspace ID, User ID settings, create thread, send and run, Polling Event Timeline, and AI Server connected / disconnected / unreachable state.
- Desktop Chat Panel: `worker_console_desktop` mirrors the Chat Panel foundation. Tauri native validation still depends on the customer machine Rust/MSVC environment.
- Polling Event Timeline: frontends call `GET /api/v1/conversations/{thread_id}/events` manually or every 5 seconds and show `event_type`, `message`, `created_at`, and `payload JSON`.
- Frontend config: `VITE_AI_SERVER_API=http://localhost:8000`, `VITE_WORKSPACE_ID=demo-workspace`, `VITE_USER_ID=demo-user`.
- Development CORS: backend `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allows `http://localhost:5173`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, `http://localhost:5180`, `http://127.0.0.1:5180`, `tauri://localhost`, and related local development origins.

Boundaries: current implementation is not WebSocket, not SSE, and not a full ChatGPT UI. It does not implement TikTok / YouTube / X automation, login, cookie injection, proxy pools, fingerprint bypass, captcha automation, real platform automation, real OpenClaw, or ComfyUI.
## Phase 38 Validation Addendum

Real client worker E2E validation can add a Conversation run scenario: create a conversation, send “open https://example.com and take a screenshot”, then check `route_name=browser`, `selected_tool=browser_tool`, `events_created`, `result_metadata`, and events `route_selected`, `tool_execution_started`, and `tool_execution_completed`. If the client worker is offline, mark the run SKIPPED or clearly failed. Do not fake success.

## Phase 41 Validation Addendum

After a real client Playbook or Conversation run completes, validate Output Library with `GET /api/v1/output-artifacts`, `POST /api/v1/output-artifacts/from-playbook-run/{run_id}`, `POST /api/v1/output-artifacts/from-message/{message_id}`, and `GET /api/v1/output-artifacts/{artifact_id}/export?format=markdown`. Screenshot artifacts keep path references and do not copy large files. There is no S3 / MinIO integration and this is not a full DAM.
## Phase 42: Task Orchestration & Background Execution

This phase adds the Task Orchestration foundation: `task_runs`, `task_run_events`, `TaskOrchestratorService`, `BackgroundTaskExecutor`, and `TaskRetryPolicy`. Conversation / Playbook runs can use `execution_mode=background`, then `/api/v1/task-runs` exposes queued, running, waiting_approval, retrying, completed, failed, cancelled, expired state plus timeline events. `scheduled_at` supports scheduled runs; retry uses exponential backoff; approval resume continues to enforce the Phase 39 Approval Gate; Output Library artifacts are linked by `task_run_id`.

Boundary: this is an in-process queue, not Celery / RabbitMQ / Kubernetes scheduler / production HA distributed queue. It does not implement real publishing, real OpenClaw, ComfyUI, CAPTCHA handling, proxies, or fingerprint bypass.
## Phase 43: Task Scheduler Persistence & Worker Recovery (Completed)

Completed: Task Scheduler Persistence, `task_scheduler_state`, Task Lease fields on `task_runs`, `TaskRecoveryService`, Scheduler Health API, manual recovery API, Failed Diagnostics, and frontend scheduler health panels.

Task Lease: running task runs receive `lease_owner`, `lease_token`, `lease_expires_at`, and `heartbeat_at`. Expired lease and stale heartbeat are recoverable through scan or manual recover.

Recovery rules: running + expired lease or stale heartbeat -> retrying if retry budget remains, otherwise failed; pending scheduled due -> queued; retrying delay elapsed -> queued; waiting_approval is not auto-executed; completed/cancelled/expired are not recovered.

Admin Dashboard now shows Scheduler Health, lease status, recoverable badge, diagnostics panel, scheduled due indicator, and manual recover. Worker Console and Worker Console Desktop show simplified Task recovery state.

Boundary: this remains an in-process scheduler foundation, not Celery, not Kubernetes, and not production HA distributed queue.

<!-- PHASE44_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 44: Output Artifact Pipeline & Export System

Phase 44 adds the Output Artifact Pipeline & Export System on top of the Phase 41 Output Library and Phase 42/43 task runtime. It adds Artifact lineage, relationship graph tracking with `artifact_relationships`, export/package services, retention policy preview, and frontend Artifact Explorer controls.

Completed in this phase:

- `output_artifacts` now records `parent_artifact_id`, `root_artifact_id`, `source_task_run_id`, `source_playbook_run_id`, `source_conversation_id`, `source_runtime_session_id`, `artifact_role`, `artifact_stage`, `generated_by`, `exportable`, `retention_policy`, and `expires_at`.
- `artifact_relationships` records relationship graph edges such as `derived_from`, `packaged_into`, `summarized_from`, `exported_from`, and `replay_of`.
- `ArtifactExportService` supports `export_markdown`, `export_html`, `export_json`, `export_bundle_zip`, and `export_report_package` without re-running browser runtime or playbook execution.
- `ArtifactPackagingService` supports `package_playbook_run`, `package_task_run`, `package_browser_runtime_session`, and `package_conversation` to create package artifacts and `bundle.zip` metadata.
- `ArtifactRetentionService` supports retention policy, expiration scan, cleanup preview, and soft archive foundations. Current cleanup preview does not delete physical files.
- API additions include `GET /api/v1/output-artifacts/{artifact_id}/lineage`, `GET /api/v1/output-artifacts/{artifact_id}/relationships`, `POST /api/v1/output-artifacts/{artifact_id}/export`, `POST /api/v1/output-artifacts/{artifact_id}/package`, and `POST /api/v1/output-artifacts/cleanup/preview`.
- Storage roots now include `storage/output_artifacts`, `storage/output_packages`, and `storage/output_exports`.
- Admin Dashboard adds Artifact Explorer, lineage graph panel, export actions, package actions, retention badge, archived indicator, and bundle metadata preview.
- Worker Console and Worker Console Desktop expose simplified export, package, lineage summary, and retention status controls.

Boundaries:

- This is not a full DAM system.
- This is not a production object storage platform.
- There is no production S3 / MinIO / CDN integration.
- Export never re-executes Browser Runtime, Playbook, Conversation, OpenClaw, or Task actions.
- There is still no TikTok / YouTube / X automation, no automatic login, no captcha automation, no proxy pool, no fingerprint bypass, no real OpenClaw, and no ComfyUI.
<!-- PHASE44_SYNC:END -->

<!-- PHASE45_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 45: Workflow State & Agent Memory Foundation

Status: completed.

Phase 45 adds recoverable Workflow State and Agent Memory Snapshots across Conversation, Playbook, Task, and Artifact runtime. It is a foundation for long multi-step automation, not a full workflow builder and not ComfyUI.

Completed scope:

- `workflow_runs` stores workflow status, source links, `conversation_thread_id`, `playbook_run_id`, `task_run_id`, `current_step`, variables, context, checkpoints, pause/resume/failure timestamps, and metadata.
- `workflow_steps` stores ordered step execution with `step_index`, `step_name`, `step_type`, status, input/output payloads, error, duration, and metadata.
- `workflow_checkpoints` stores immutable checkpoint records with auto/manual/approval/failure/resume checkpoint types plus state, variables, and context snapshots.
- `agent_memory_snapshots` stores durable memory snapshots for `conversation_summary`, `task_context`, `tool_result`, `decision`, `approval_context`, and `artifact_summary`.
- `WorkflowStateService` supports create workflow, list/get workflow, variables/context update, start/complete/fail step, pause workflow, resume workflow, complete workflow, fail workflow, create/restore checkpoint, create memory snapshot, and list memory snapshots.
- Conversation events now include `workflow_run_created`, `workflow_step_started`, `workflow_step_completed`, `workflow_checkpoint_created`, `workflow_paused`, `workflow_resumed`, and `memory_snapshot_created`.
- Playbook and Task execution now optionally link to `workflow_run_id`; each playbook step can create a `workflow_step`; waiting approval moves workflow status to `waiting_approval`; completion/failure creates final/failure checkpoints.
- Output Artifact lineage now supports `workflow_run_id`, `workflow_step_id`, `checkpoint_id`, and `memory_snapshot_id` so artifacts can be traced back to workflow state.
- Admin Dashboard adds Workflow Runs with step timeline, variables viewer, context viewer, checkpoints list, Agent Memory Snapshots, and Pause / Resume controls.
- Worker Console and Worker Console Desktop show simplified Workflow State, current step, checkpoint count, memory summary, and linked workflow ids.

API coverage:

- `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/steps`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/checkpoints`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/pause`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/resume`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/checkpoints`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/memory-snapshots`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/memory-snapshots`
- `GET /api/v1/agent-memory-snapshots`

Boundaries: this is not a full workflow builder, not ComfyUI, not WebSocket/SSE streaming, not real OpenClaw, not real social-platform publishing, and not TikTok / YouTube / X automation. It does not add automatic login, CAPTCHA automation, proxy pools, or fingerprint bypass.
<!-- PHASE45_SYNC:END -->

<!-- PHASE46_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 46 Note

Real client worker E2E validation is unchanged by Workflow Graph Runtime. Graph planner and Replay Foundation metadata may reference browser/runtime artifacts through `producing_node_key`, `replay_source`, and `graph_lineage`, but this does not add remote desktop streaming, ComfyUI, real OpenClaw, or social platform automation.
<!-- PHASE46_SYNC:END -->

<!-- PHASE47_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 47: Real Client Worker E2E Relationship

Workflow Template Registry & Versioning runs on AI Server. The real client Worker E2E validation flow is unchanged. A template can select a Browser Graph template that triggers Remote Browser Runtime, but it must still pass approval and risk gates. The current system still does not implement TikTok / YouTube / X automation, login, captcha automation, proxy pools, fingerprint bypass, real OpenClaw, or ComfyUI.
<!-- PHASE47_SYNC:END -->

<!-- PHASE48_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 48: Workflow Template Marketplace & Governance Foundation

Status: completed.

Phase 48 adds an internal Workflow Template Marketplace & Governance foundation on top of Phase 47 Workflow Template Registry & Versioning. It is an internal template library and governance layer, not public marketplace, not a paid marketplace, not multi-tenant SaaS marketplace, not a visual DAG editor, and not ComfyUI.

Completed scope:

- Added `workflow_template_reviews` for review queue, `review_status`, `risk_assessment`, `compatibility_report`, approve / reject / request changes.
- Added `workflow_template_promotions` to record activate, rollback, deprecate, and archive lifecycle events with `promotion_type`, source version, target version, and reason.
- Added `workflow_template_audit_logs` for governance audit trail, actor, previous_state, new_state, and metadata.
- Added `workflow_template_compatibility_matrix` for runtime capabilities: `browser_runtime`, `approval_gate`, `task_scheduler`, `artifact_pipeline`, `workflow_graph_runtime`, `openclaw_mock`, and `rag_pipeline`.
- Added `WorkflowTemplateGovernanceService` with `submit_for_review`, `approve_review`, `reject_review`, `request_changes`, `activate_template_version`, `rollback_template_version`, `deprecate_template`, `archive_template`, `list_review_queue`, and `list_governance_events`.
- Template lifecycle is draft -> review -> approved -> active -> deprecated -> archived. Activation requires approved review; only one active version is default; deprecated templates are not default-runnable; archived templates cannot run; rollback does not delete old versions.
- Marketplace foundation records `featured`, `verified`, `recommended`, `usage_count`, `success_rate`, `average_runtime_ms`, and `average_step_count` on `workflow_templates`, then exposes governance badges, risk badge, verified badge, featured templates, and recommended templates.
- Output Artifact lineage adds `source_template_review_id` and `governance_state`; Workflow Runs can record template governance state and compatibility snapshot.
- Admin Dashboard adds Template Governance with Review Queue, Approval / Reject / Request Changes, Template Lifecycle View, Audit Log View, Marketplace View, Compatibility Matrix View, and Rollback UI.
- Worker Console and Worker Console Desktop show governance status, template verification status, and compatibility summary in Template Library.

API coverage:

- `GET /api/v1/workflow-template-reviews`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-template-reviews`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-template-reviews/{review_id}/approve`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-template-reviews/{review_id}/reject`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-template-reviews/{review_id}/request-changes`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-templates/{template_id}/rollback/{version_id}`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-templates/{template_id}/deprecate`
- `POST /api/v1/workflow-templates/{template_id}/archive`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-template-audit-logs`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-template-marketplace`
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-template-compatibility-matrix`

Boundaries: Phase 48 is not public marketplace, not a visual DAG builder, not a distributed orchestration platform, not ComfyUI, not TikTok / YouTube / X automation, not real platform publishing, not automatic login, not CAPTCHA automation, not proxy pool, and not fingerprint bypass.
<!-- PHASE48_SYNC:END -->

## Phase 49: Workflow Run Observability & Replay Center

Completed the Workflow Run Observability & Replay Center foundation: added `workflow_execution_traces`, `workflow_runtime_diagnostics`, `workflow_replay_sessions`, and integrated `WorkflowExecutionTraceService` plus `WorkflowDiagnosticsService`. The runtime now records node_started / node_completed / node_failed / planner_decision / retry_triggered / fallback_triggered / approval_wait / approval_resume / replay_started / replay_completed for Execution Trace, Runtime Summary, Failure Hotspots, Replay Center, and metadata_only / dry_run replay sessions.

New APIs: `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/traces`, `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/diagnostics`, `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/analytics`, `POST /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/replay-sessions`, `GET /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id}/runtime-summary`, `GET /api/v1/workflow-replay-sessions`, and `GET /api/v1/workflow-replay-sessions/{replay_session_id}`.

Admin Dashboard now includes Replay Center / Workflow Observability views for Execution Trace Timeline, Node Inspection Panel, Retry/Fallback Visualization, Diagnostics Panel, Runtime Summary, Replay Session View, Failure Hotspots, and Approval Wait Visualization. Worker Console / Desktop show a simplified trace timeline, replay session status, diagnostics summary, and retry/fallback counters.

Boundaries: this is not a distributed tracing platform, not an OpenTelemetry stack, not WebSocket/SSE realtime, not a deterministic replay engine, not a visual DAG editor, does not connect ComfyUI, does not perform real social publishing, and does not implement Kubernetes orchestration.

Keywords: not distributed tracing platform; not deterministic replay engine; not ComfyUI.

## Phase 50: Desktop Console Runtime UX & Client Packaging Readiness

Phase 50 adds Desktop Console Runtime UX & Client Packaging Readiness. The Tauri icon resource is now explicit: `worker_console_desktop/src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` is a valid local placeholder icon and `bundle.icon` points to `["icons/icon.ico"]`.

Start Runtime diagnostics now surface clear states: `starting`, `started`, `failed`, `unavailable`, `port_conflict`, `missing_config`, and `server_environment_warning`. The Desktop Console shows local worker diagnostics for `/local/status`, `/local/health`, runtime port, `server_url`, `worker_base_url`, last attempted action, last error detail, and last successful sync.

Server/client boundary: Desktop Console controls the worker runtime on this local machine. If running on the server host, Start Runtime starts a server-local worker, not a remote customer machine. For real client E2E, run this app on the customer machine.

This phase is packaging readiness only: not final installer, no code signing, no auto updater, no MSI/EXE release packaging, and not ComfyUI.

Keywords: Desktop Console Runtime UX & Client Packaging Readiness; Tauri icon resource; icons/icon.ico; bundle.icon; Start Runtime diagnostics; missing_config; port_conflict; server_environment_warning; local worker diagnostics; customer machine; not final installer; no code signing; no auto updater.
<!-- PHASE51_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 51: Release Packaging & Deployment Bundle Foundation

Status: completed.

Phase 51 adds the Release Packaging & Deployment Bundle Foundation. It introduces a `release/` directory with `release/manifest.json`, `release/version.json`, `release/env/aiops.release.env.template`, server deployment bundle scripts, frontend production build bundle scripts, desktop release readiness scripts, Windows / Mac startup scripts, and `release/scripts/validate_release_packaging.py`.

Packaging architecture:

- Server deployment bundle: `release/scripts/build_server_bundle.ps1` and `release/scripts/build_server_bundle.sh` collect API server, worker, worker_client, Alembic, Docker, docs runtime metadata, and env template sources under ignored `release/build/server`.
- Frontend production build bundle: `release/scripts/build_frontend_bundles.ps1` and `release/scripts/build_frontend_bundles.sh` run production builds for Admin Dashboard, Worker Console, and Worker Console Desktop frontend assets, then copy `dist` output under ignored `release/build/frontends`.
- Desktop release readiness: `release/scripts/check_desktop_release_readiness.ps1` and `.sh` verify Tauri config, `icons/icon.ico`, package metadata, and Cargo/toolchain presence without producing a signed installer.
- Version metadata: `release/version.json` records Phase 51 package metadata and component readiness.
- Release manifest: `release/manifest.json` is the packaging SSOT for components, outputs, startup scripts, validation script, and forbidden runtime artifacts.
- Validation: `release/scripts/validate_release_packaging.py` checks required files, manifest JSON, version JSON, desktop icon config, boundaries, and forbidden artifact declarations.

Boundaries: Phase 51 is not a formal production release, no code signing, no auto updater, no MSI/EXE formal installer, no DMG/notarization, no Kubernetes/Helm packaging, no ComfyUI, and no real social platform publishing.

 Phase 51  release readiness  code signing, auto updater, MSI/EXE, DMG/notarization, Kubernetes/Helm.

Keywords: Phase 51; Release Packaging & Deployment Bundle Foundation; release/manifest.json; release/version.json; server deployment bundle; frontend production build bundle; desktop release readiness; aiops.release.env.template; validate_release_packaging.py; Windows / Mac startup scripts; not a formal production release; no code signing; no auto updater; no MSI/EXE; no DMG/notarization; no Kubernetes/Helm.
<!-- PHASE51_SYNC:END -->
<!-- PHASE52_SYNC:START -->
## Phase 52: Deployment Profiles & Environment Bootstrap

Status: completed.

Phase 52 adds Deployment Profiles & Environment Bootstrap on top of Phase 51 release packaging. It introduces `deployment/` with profile-based configuration for `local-dev`, `server-docker`, `client-worker`, `desktop-client`, `staging`, and `production-like`. Each profile contains `profile.json`, `env.template`, `ports.json`, `services.json`, `healthchecks.json`, and `README.md`.

Completed scope:

- `deployment/scripts/generate_env.py` generates `.env.generated` or a specified output from a profile `env.template`, supports override JSON, validates required keys, and refuses to overwrite existing env files without `--force`.
- `deployment/scripts/check_dependencies.py` checks Python, Docker, Docker Compose, Node/npm, Git, Playwright/client worker advisories, Rust/cargo, MSVC/link.exe on Windows, Tauri icon readiness, and WebView2 advisory by profile.
- `deployment/scripts/check_ports.py` checks API 8000, Admin Dashboard 5180, Worker Console 5173, Desktop Console 5174, Worker Runtime 9100, PostgreSQL 5432, Redis 6379, and Qdrant 6333 from each profile `ports.json`; it reports process hints and never kills processes.
- `deployment/scripts/verify_environment.py` verifies `server-docker`, `client-worker`, and `desktop-client` health: docker compose ps, API health, browser-worker health, workflow routes smoke, task-runs smoke, output-artifacts smoke, local worker status/health, Tauri config/icon, and frontend build presence where applicable.
- Added Windows / Mac startup scripts under `deployment/windows/` and `deployment/mac/` for server Docker, Admin Dashboard, Worker Console, Desktop Console, client worker, and profile verification.
- Release integration updates `release/manifest.json`, `release/version.json`, `release/README.md`, and `release/scripts/validate_release_packaging.py` to include deployment profiles, bootstrap scripts, dependency checks, port checks, and profile verification.
- Admin Dashboard, Worker Console, and Worker Console Desktop Settings / Help now show recommended profile, AI Server URL, Workspace ID, User ID, Local Worker API, server/client/desktop role differences, and profile bootstrap docs link.

Boundaries: Phase 52 is not Kubernetes/Helm/Terraform, not Ansible, not production HA, not code signing, not an auto updater, not a formal installer, not ComfyUI, and not real social platform publishing.

Keywords: Phase 52; Deployment Profiles & Environment Bootstrap; local-dev; server-docker; client-worker; desktop-client; staging; production-like; generate_env.py; check_dependencies.py; check_ports.py; verify_environment.py; env generation; dependency checks; port checks; health verification; profile bootstrap docs; Kubernetes/Helm/Terraform.
